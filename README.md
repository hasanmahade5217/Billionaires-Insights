# Billionaires-Insights

Billionaires, individuals whose net worth exceeds a billion dollars, represent a unique segment of the global elite, wielding significant economic influence. Analyzing data related to billionaires can provide profound insights into wealth distribution, economic trends, and business success factors. By examining their industries of origin, investment strategies, and philanthropic endeavors, one can uncover patterns that offer a deeper understanding of wealth creation and societal impact. Additionally, data analysis can reveal correlations between economic indicators and billionaire fortunes, shedding light on the interconnected nature of financial markets. 

The dataset that I am using to analyze the data about billionaires around the world was curated by Forbes and is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about global billionaires in 2023. Below are all the features in the data:

- personName:  individual's name.
- finalWorth: net worth.
- country: home country.
- source: wealth source.
- category: industry category.
- selfMade: self-made or inherited wealth.
- rank: billionaire rank.
